# GATK AnalyzeCovariates fail

See solution here:Â http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/4294/analyzecovariates-fails-with-error-message-rscript-exited-with-1 The problem is most likely that some package missing in R. So install them in R and can run the R script for generating plot separately.
